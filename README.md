# Autism Detection, Prevention & Cure Webapp

> **Abstract** : Early detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is crucial for timely intervention and support, enabling individuals on the spectrum to receive appropriate assistance and resources. This research paper presents a novel approach to detecting ASD through a suite of interactive games and assessments. Our proposed system evaluates motor, cognitive, social, and emotional skills by engaging users in a series of tasks designed to assess various domains associated with ASD. These include the AQ-10 test, finger-tapping exercises, visual memory games, emotional development games, hand-eye coordination assessments, and video recordings of daily activities. By analyzing the user's performance and behavior across these multi-modal assessments, our system aims to identify autistic traits and determine the presence and severity of ASD. The research highlights the potential of this approach to facilitate accessible and cost-effective screening for ASD, ultimately supporting early identification and intervention efforts.
