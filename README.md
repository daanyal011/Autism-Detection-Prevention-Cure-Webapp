# Autism Detection, Prevention & Cure Webapp

> **Abstract** : Developed a web application for early detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) through a suite of interactive games and assessments. Implemented various assessments, including AQ-10 test, finger-tapping exercises, visual memory games, emotional development games, hand-eye coordination assessments, and video recordings of daily activities. Analyzed user performance and behavior across these multi-modal assessments to identify autistic traits and determine the presence and severity of ASD. Utilized ReactJS, Streamlit, and FlutterFlow frameworks to build the application's frontend and backend components. Facilitated accessible and cost-effective screening for ASD, supporting early identification and intervention efforts.

## Research Paper: Game-Changing Approach - Detecting Autism Spectrum Disorder Through Interactive Assessments
- **Description:** Presenting an innovative approach to detecting ASD using a suite of interactive games and assessments. The system evaluates motor, cognitive, social, and emotional skills by engaging users in a series of tasks designed to assess various domains associated with ASD. By analyzing user performance and behavior across these multi-modal assessments, the system aims to identify autistic traits and determine the presence and severity of ASD. The paper highlights the potential of this approach to facilitate accessible and cost-effective screening for ASD, ultimately supporting early identification and intervention efforts.
